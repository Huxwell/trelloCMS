# TrelloCMS

## What is this?

Content management system using Trello as a backend. Create websites quickly
and effortlessly!

## How to use?

1. Download the code and unzip it to your website root directory.
2. Sing up over at [Trello](http://trello.com) and copy our sample board (Show
   sidebar->Menu->Copy Board->Create)
3. In `trelloCMS/data/trelloJSON.php` replace $board_id with your actual board
   id.

Now everything should be working and you should be able to toy with it by
adding lists or cards or editing stuff. If something does not work, try
changing your board visibility to Public. Don't worry about your data, your
boards can be edited only by people who have been explicitly added to your
board.
