TrelloCMS
=========

::How to use::

After downloading the code, unzip it and upload to your website root directory.

Then sign up at trello and copy our sample board (Show sidebar->Menu->Copy Board->Create). 

Now just raplace $board_id = "NThkZ2R1"; at /trelloCMS/data/trelloJSON.php into your board id, which you just copy from the url. 

Everything should be working right now, so just play with adding trello lists, cards, changing their order, adding attachments. 
If something goes wrong, try changeing your board privacy to "Public". Nobody who is not added to board won't be able to edit your content anyway.
